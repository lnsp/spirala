This is the repository of the Spirala Project, a self-hosted private cloud platform based on Docker Swarm.
It was created to replace easy-to-use systems like Dokku that cannot be used for Docker Swarm. The release target is to provide
a fully integrated private cloud using only Open-Source components.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Display information from Docker Client
- [ ] Allow use of SSL certificates
- [ ] Create and edit Docker components
- [ ] Use Stack templates for easy service creation
- [ ] Add workflow interface to allow visual infrastructure composition
